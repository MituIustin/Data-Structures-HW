In this file I just implemented a linked list and a skip list. 
My algorithm does not fully comply with the requirement because 
I chose to do only 1000 insertions/searches/deletions instead of 10000, 
but I think it is enough to notice that a skip list is more efficient. 
This is the significant difference, I inserted/searched and deleted the same names and numbers. 
For simplicity, I preferred that instead of generating a random phone number, I generated a number smaller than 99999.
