The algorithm implements an intersection detection mechanism for line segments using an AVL tree data structure. 
It allows us to efficiently find whether two line segments intersect or not, and if they do, it also determines 
the coordinates of the intersection point.

The algorithm begins by defining structures for a point and a line segment. 
The line segments are represented by their starting and ending points. It also defines a structure for an AVL node, 
which holds a line segment, as well as pointers to its left and right children in the AVL tree.

The algorithm provides various helper functions to perform operations on the AVL tree. 
These functions include creating a new AVL node, getting the height of a node, calculating the balance factor, 
updating the height, and performing left and right rotations to balance the AVL tree.

To find the intersection point, the algorithm inserts line segments into the AVL tree using the insertSegment function. 
Each insertion triggers AVL tree balancing to maintain the tree's height balance property.

To check if two line segments intersect, the algorithm uses the doSegmentsIntersect function, which calculates the 
direction of the line segments based on their coordinates. If the directions satisfy certain conditions, 
indicating intersection, the function returns true.

Once an intersection is detected, the algorithm uses the findIntersectionPoint function to calculate the coordinates 
of the intersection point by solving a system of linear equations.

Finally, the findIntersectionInAVLTree function searches for the intersection point within the AVL tree. It traverses 
the tree based on the coordinates of the input segment and checks for intersections with each segment in the tree. 
If an intersection is found, the corresponding intersection point is returned.
